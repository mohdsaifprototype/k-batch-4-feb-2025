        Kashmir is a region located in the northern part of the Indian
        subcontinent. It is a disputed territory, claimed by India and Pakistan,
        and divided between them since 1947. The Indian-administered part of
        Kashmir is referred to as Jammu and Kashmir, while the
        Pakistani-administered part is referred to as Azad Kashmir and Gilgit
        Baltistan. The region is known for its natural beauty, with the
        Himalayan mountains and the Kashmir Valley being popular tourist
        destinations.
